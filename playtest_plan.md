# Playtest Plan

## Session Goals
- Verify intro story pages display cleanly.  
- Pull lever → speak to friend → log grows.  
- Meditation menu always reachable.  
- Breaks (meal, exercise, sleep) trigger at thresholds.  

## Regression Checklist
- ✅ Lever list prints 1–16 with no orphaned “q. quit”.  
- ✅ Friend manifest loads; dialogue actions menu displays.  
- ✅ Choosing “q” at lab console routes to Meditation.  
- ✅ Save file (`lab_save.json`) created and valid.  
- ✅ Build script leaves exactly 2 clean zips.  

## Logging Notes
- Capture any runtime error messages.  
- Record SHA256s from build summary.  
- Note dialogue pacing or awkward menus for revision.
