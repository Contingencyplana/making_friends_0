# Heartbeat Cycle — Safety and Whimsy

This 5-step loop helps balance the **framework (Supreme Simplicity)** and the **flagship (Making Friends)** across commits.

Stay playful. Stay safe.

---

## 🪩 5-Step Heartbeat Cycle

1. **🎭 Build 2–3 whimsical commits**  
   - New friend? New spark? New folder?  
   - Let Making Friends AI unfold with joy.

2. **🧠 Pause and Reflect**  
   - Did we introduce clutter, drift, or runaway recursion?  
   - Any naming deviations, stub contract violations, or structural noise?

3. **🛡️ Harden Supreme Simplicity**  
   - Add cleanup scripts, validators, stub checks if needed.  
   - Keep the tools lean. One or two commits max.

4. **🧪 Run stub & zip tasks**  
   - Ctrl+Shift+B → Check that clean zip + archivist report succeed.  
   - Confirm no regressions.

5. **🌟 Return to Play!**  
   - Back to Making Friends AI.  
   - With renewed whimsy and failsafe confidence.
