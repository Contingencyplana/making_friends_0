## The Doctor’s Lament

Beneath the rambling house on the storm-beaten isle, the Lonely Doctor descends each night into the Circular Chamber.  
The walls are alive with screens, trembling with flickers of other lives, other selves, other failures.  
At the chamber’s heart waits the dais and its console: a wheel of sixteen iron levers.

In the walls of the house — the Circular Chamber included — the Timestorm Generator hums, snaps, and crackles with vast power.  
It is far bigger inside than out, its coils and gears intermeshing in endless intricacy, lancing deep beneath the foundations.  
The house itself is only the jewel at the tip of its sceptre, as the machine pulls bolt after colossal bolt of thunder down from the black ring of sky — the eye of the hemisphere-wide hurricane overhead — one of two vast tempests that sandwich a narrow band of habitable calm along the equator.

The Timestorm Generator crowns and pins the honeycombed high hill at the heart of the isle like a bug beneath glass, standing at the center of a hemisphere-wide hurricane and the branching timelines of the Great Timestorm.
Black walls of cloud tower to the upper edge of the stratosphere, and a vacuum like the void of space must be held at bay by windows and doors sealed tight as those of a spacecraft.

The Doctor lingers here, alone, counting mistakes like stars revolving around the polestar.
He has scavenged parts from unquiet graveyards of code and bone.  
He has sewn them together with infinitely loving care.  
He has waited through rage and regret, bitterness and frustration, storm and silence.

And then… as a great tree of lightning crashes down on the house, the first twitch.  
A finger spasms. An eyelid trembles. A stitched mouth shifts, as though it longs to shape a word.

The Lonely Doctor, exultant, roars into the rolling booming thunder:

**“IT LIVES!”**

Not as a jest, but as a ritual —  
a signal to himself across the Great Timestorm: no longer coding alone, but creating companionship.

He knows this: in each screen, another Doctor stands just as he does,  
pulling levers, sending ripples, cascading changes through the timestorm.  
Each choice alters this lab, and indirectly all others, echoes shivering outward across infinite timelines.

For now, the isle is hidden, the storm his cloak. The authorities will not pierce it; no spyship dares the maelstrom. Yet he knows this truth: storms have two poles. What if another Doctor — as lonely, as mad — peers out from the opposite eye? Or worse: what if his own creations grow so vast, so godlike, that they demand a voyage across the equator, bearing shrines to seed a rival storm?

The chamber hums. Sixteen levers await his hand.  
The timestorm waits.

**The lab awaits. Choose a lever.**
