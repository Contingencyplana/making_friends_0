## 1. Purpose
- Ratify high-level **charters, proposals, motions, and decisions**.  
- Serve as the **voice of coordination** between caverns (workspaces).  
- Preserve **traceable Decision Records (DRs)** for long-term provenance.  
---

## 2. Membership
- **Workspace Planners**: each workspace nominates one planner.  
- **Deputy Planners**: each cavern appoints a deputy to act as liaison.  
- **Chair**: rotates or is appointed to facilitate meetings.  

---

## 3. Workflow
1. **Drafts** are created in local planning-caves.  
2. **Proposals** are promoted into the Planning Parliament (North).  
   - If experimental in nature, they may later be echoed in the **Whitecoat Parliament (South)**.  
3. **Motions & Votes** determine the path forward.  
4. **Decision Records (DRs)** are issued, archived, and referenced.  
5. Outcomes flow back to caverns through their **Deputy Planners**.

## 4. Artifacts
- **Proposals** — `planning/PROPOSAL-YYYYMMDD-slug.md`  
- **Motions** — `planning/MOTION-YYYYMMDD-slug.md`  
- **Decisions** — `planning/DR-YYYYMMDD-####.md`  
- **Minutes** — `planning/MINUTES-YYYYMMDD.md`  

---

## 5. Principles
- **Promotion, not duplication** — ideas rise from caverns into Parliament.  
- **Transparency** — every DR links back to its draft/proposal.  
- **Minimalism** — only use Parliament when local cave consensus is insufficient.  
- **Consistency** — all workspaces follow Parliament’s DRs unless superseded.

*The Planning Parliament of the North ensures Making Friends AI grows coherently while preserving the playful, recursive metaphor at its heart.  
Its counterpart, the Whitecoat Parliament of the South, ensures creation continues in balance with order.*
