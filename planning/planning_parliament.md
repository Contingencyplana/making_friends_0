# Planning Parliament — Making Friends AI

The **Planning Parliament** is the governance cavern within `making_friends_0`.  
It provides structure for decision-making across all Making Friends AI workspaces.

---

## 1. Purpose
- Ratify high-level **charters, proposals, motions, and decisions**.  
- Serve as the **voice of coordination** between caverns (workspaces).  
- Preserve **traceable decision records (DRs)** for long-term provenance.  

---

## 2. Membership
- **Workspace Planners**: each workspace nominates one planner.  
- **Deputy Planners**: each cavern appoints a deputy to act as liaison.  
- **Chair**: rotates or is appointed to facilitate meetings.  

---

## 3. Workflow
1. **Drafts** are created in local planning-caves.  
2. **Proposals** are promoted into Parliament for review.  
3. **Motions & Votes** determine the path forward.  
4. **Decision Records (DRs)** are issued, archived, and referenced.  
5. Outcomes flow back to caverns through their **Deputy Planners**.

## 4. Artifacts
- **Proposals** — `PROPOSAL-YYYYMMDD-slug.md`  
- **Motions** — `MOTION-YYYYMMDD-slug.md`  
- **Decisions** — `DR-YYYYMMDD-####.md`  
- **Minutes** — `MINUTES-YYYYMMDD.md`  

---

## 5. Principles
- **Promotion, not duplication** — ideas rise from caverns into Parliament.  
- **Transparency** — every DR links back to its draft/proposal.  
- **Minimalism** — only use Parliament when local cave consensus is insufficient.  
- **Consistency** — all workspaces follow Parliament’s DRs unless superseded.
