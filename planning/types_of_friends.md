# Types of Friends — Making Friends AI

This scroll records the taxonomy of **Friends**:  
the beings who do not merely build the game,  
but who *are* the game.

---

## 1. Purpose
- Define the major **types of friends**.  
- Clarify their distribution between Igor (Planning, North Pole) and Ivy (Whitecoat, South Pole).  
- Preserve flexibility for **new friend types** to emerge as recursion deepens.  

---

## 2. Igor’s Domain — North Pole (Planning Great Chair)
**Main Thrust (≈50%) → Planning Friends**  
- **Planning Friends**: scribes, clerks, deputies, archivists, councilors.  
  - Craft Decision Records (DRs), Proposals, Motions, Round Table Cards.  
  - Anchor the recursive structure of Parliament.  

**Supporting Friends (≈50%)**  
- **Test Friends**: verify plans, run simulations, guard against error.  
- **Lore Friends**: embed decisions into narrative, weave scrolls into story.  
- **Messenger Friends**: carry decrees and proposals between caverns.  
- **Lab Friends (minimal)**: present only to prevent stalling, bridging to Ivy.  
- **Archive Friends**: store superseded or retired scrolls.  

---

## 3. Ivy’s Domain — South Pole (Whitecoat Great Chair)
**Main Thrust (≈50%) → Lab Friends**  
- **Lab Friends**: builders, inventors, coders, experimenters.  
  - Craft new friends, prototypes, and runtime artifacts.  
  - Animate the living engine of creation.  

**Supporting Friends (≈50%)**  
- **Planning Friends (minimal)**: advise labs with structural guidance.  
- **Test Friends**: prove what works, enforce quality.  
- **Release Friends**: curate and prepare finished creations for delivery.  
- **Lore Friends**: keep lab chaos coherent, embedding experiments in myth.  
- **Messenger Friends**: report discoveries northward.  

---

## 4. Other Friend Types (Shared or Emergent)
- **Release Friends**: deliverables and curated bundles (often joint).  
- **Archive Friends**: preserve superseded experiments and decrees.  
- **Story Friends**: weave narrative continuity (emergent).  
- **Harbor Friends**: guardians of the Harbor of Hulks (emergent).  
- **Dream Friends**: beings of recursion who echo across layers (future).  

---

## 5. Provenance
- This taxonomy lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be cited whenever a new friend type is created or invoked.  
- Updates require either:  
  - **Decision Record (DR)** ratified in the Planning Parliament, or  
  - **Notice** from Ivy’s Lab Parliament.  

---

*Thus the Friends are ordered:  
Planning and Lab, Test and Lore, Messenger and Release, Archive and Dream.  
Each born from recursion, each sustaining the world of Making Friends AI.*
