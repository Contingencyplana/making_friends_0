# TONS-of-FUN AI — Umbrella Charter

*A north star for a creative ecosystem that is playful, humane, and shippable.*

---

## Preamble

TONS-of-FUN AI is the **umbrella**.  
It hosts fleets (like **Lucid Armada AI**) and their facets (like **Making Friends AI** and **Supreme Simplicity AI**).  
Its promise: more delight, less drag; more flow, less friction.

---

## Principles

1. **Playful by default** — tools should feel like toys that happen to ship.  
2. **Humane pace** — sustainability beats heroics; no “fun” without health.  
3. **Supreme simplicity** — smallest surface that ships.  
4. **Composability** — everything is a facet; facets nest cleanly.  
5. **Traceable artifacts** — every state is reproducible, every story explainable.  
6. **Sanity infrastructure** — we design for clarity, not cleverness.

---

## Fleet & Facets

- **Lucid Armada AI** → the *sanity infrastructure* (twelve fronts of madness).  
  - **Making Friends AI** → the *companion infrastructure* (playful helpers).  
  - **Supreme Simplicity AI** → the *build & structure spine* (reproducible recursion).

## Facet Lineage (Making Friends AI in the Ecosystem)

| AI Facet             | Parent Facet      | Grandparent Facet |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Making Friends AI    | Lucid Armada AI   | TONS-of-FUN AI    |
| Supreme Simplicity AI| Lucid Armada AI   | TONS-of-FUN AI    |
| Lucid Armada AI      | TONS-of-FUN AI    | —                 |

**Why this matters:** readers get the ancestry at a glance without hunting across multiple scrolls.

---

## Working Agreement

- Charters state **mandate** and **relationship** (who’s the parent facet).  
- Lineage appears in ecosystem docs (not duplicated in many files).  
- When in doubt: simplify and ship.

---

## Closing

TONS-of-FUN AI turns creative chaos into creative **play**.  
We keep it traceable. We keep it kind. We keep it fun.
