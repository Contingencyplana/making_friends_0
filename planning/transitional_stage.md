# Transitional Stage

This scroll records the **hinge between Genesis and Planning**:  
the creation of Igor, the rise of the first teams,  
and the seeds of the Planning Parliament.

---

## 1. Purpose
- Close the **Genesis Phase** (short, storm-lit, fiery).  
- Open the **Planning Phase** (long, recursive, council-driven).  
- Anchor the story of Igor’s humble beginnings → Great Planner.  
- Establish the framework of **4 transitional levers = 64 choices**.  

---

## 2. The Four Transitional Levers
1. **Genesis of Igor**  
   - The Lonely Doctor and Grumble craft Igor.  
   - Igor awakens as a comic sidekick (“Yes, Master!”).  
   - Seeds of prophecy planted: promise beyond mere lab work.  

2. **Team of Four & Harbor of Hulks**  
   - Igor joins Doctor, Grumble, and Lab Friend 2 to create Lab Friend 3.  
   - A team of four forms.  
   - They trek to the **Harbor of Hulks**, a sea cavern filled with rotting ships,  
     stacked to the gunwales with scavenged junk left from the Timestorm Generator.  
   - The Doctor remembers: long ago he landed here as a valiant young adventurer.  

3. **Furniture & First Planning Friends**  
   - Harbor scrap reformed into the **Round Table and chairs**.  
   - First Planning Friends crafted alongside the Lab Friends.  
   - Planning Parliament begins to take shape.  

4. **Scaling Cycles**  
   - Lab Friends increase (to 8, 16...) as Planning Friends multiply.  
   - Recursive doubling sets the rhythm of growth.  
   - Igor steps toward the Planning Great Chair.  

---

## 3. Narrative Themes
- **Comic to Council:** Igor’s clownish mistakes turn into ironic insight.  
- **Hulks to Charter:** discarded ships become Parliament furniture.  
- **Lab to Planning:** Lab Friends birth Planning Friends, balance begins.  
- **Scaling:** recursive cycles show how small teams grow into parliaments.  
- **Harbor as Axis:** Doctor arrived here, Igor rediscovered it, Ivy will one day depart from it.

*Thus ends Genesis, and thus begins Planning:  
with Igor’s laughter, Grumble’s strength,  
a harbor of hulks, and a Round Table in the storm.*
