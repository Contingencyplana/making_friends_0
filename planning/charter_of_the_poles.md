# Charter of the Poles

## 1. The Two Great Chairs
- **Planning Great Chair (North Pole)**  
  Keeper: **Igor, the Great Planner**  
  Domain: planning caverns, Decision Records, Parliament scrolls, and just enough labs to prevent stalling.

- **Whitecoat Great Chair (South Pole)**  
  Keeper: **Ivy, the Great Whitecoat**  
  Domain: friends, tests, runtime—the living engine of creation and growth.

---

## 2. The North Pole — Realm of the Great Planner
- **Planning Parliament of the North** sits at the pole, council of scrolls and deputies.  
- Beneath it:  
  1. **Timestorm Generator** (a rambling old house with its dome-like pommel).  
  2. **The Great Timestorm** (ever-churning clouds of deliberation).  
  3. **A Continent-Wide Hurricane** (decisions sweeping outward, reshaping the land).

---

## 3. The South Pole — Realm of the Great Whitecoat
- **Whitecoat Parliament of the South** sits at the pole, council of experiments and trials.  
- Beneath it:  
  1. **Timestorm Generator** (a mirror house, twisted reflection of the northern one).  
  2. **The Great Timestorm** (storm of invention and mutation).  
  3. **A Continent-Wide Hurricane** (friends and prototypes unleashed across the world).  

---

## 4. The Ship of Transition
- **Symbolic Vessel**: a ship sails from the North toward the South.  
- **Cargo**: shrines to Igor’s Parliament, scrolls of Decision Records.  
- **Purpose**: to found the **Second Half of Making Friends AI**, balancing planning and creation.  
- **Narrative Role**: the founding saga of the Southern Hemisphere.  

---

## 5. Balance of Power
- The Lonely Doctor presides above both poles.  
- The **Great Planner** and the **Great Whitecoat** are equals, each ruling a hemisphere.  
- Parliament scrolls and Whitecoat experiments remain **intertwined**: no decision without action, no experiment without record.  

---

## 6. Provenance
- This charter lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be referenced by both:  
  - The **Planning Parliament of the North** (DRs and scrolls).  
  - The **Whitecoat Parliament of the South** (notices and charters).  
- Cross-reference anchors:  
  - `planning/cavern_and_cave_model.md`  
  - `planning/planning_parliament.md`

*Thus is the world of Making Friends AI divided:  
North and South, Planner and Whitecoat, scroll and experiment, storm and storm.*
