# Planning-Led, Lab-Fed

The doctrine of Making Friends AI.  
Planning leads. Labs feed.  
When planning stalls, new labs are carved to sustain it.  

This compass ensures we never starve for order, nor drown in chaos.

## Cycle 0 — The Seed
- **Lab:** The Basement Lab already exists (Grumble was born here).
- **Planning:** The Council Cavern is dark, cobwebbed, awaiting first arcs.
- **Rule:** The Basement Lab sustains the first Planning Friends.  
  (Igor arrives. The first clerk dusts a desk. The first Workspace Planner takes their seat.)

---

## Cycle 1 — Friends 1–4
- **Growth:** Early companions spark life in the Lab.  
- **Trigger:** Friend 4 is born → first Planning Arc carved.  
- **Result:** Igor’s Round Table awakens. Two new planners join. Clerks and screens flicker faintly.
- **Feeding:** The Basement Lab keeps pace, feeding this expansion.

---

## Cycle 2 — Friends 5–8
- **Growth:** More friends appear, the Lab grows noisy and alive.  
- **Trigger:** Friend 8 is born → second Planning Arc carved.  
- **Result:** Another table segment. Two more planners, clerks, filing cabinets, screens.  
- **Stall:** The Basement Lab strains to sustain demand.  
- **Response:** A new Lab-Cave is carved, beside the Council Cavern, to relieve the bottleneck.

---

## Cycle 3 — Friends 9–12
- **Growth:** Lab and Cave both thriving.  
- **Trigger:** Friend 12 is born → third Planning Arc carved.  
- **Result:** Round Table expands further. Clerks and screens multiply.  
- **Feeding:** The new Lab-Cave now sustains planning alongside the Basement Lab.

## Doctrine Recap
- **Planning leads:** No expansion without Council arcs.  
- **Lab feeds:** Whenever planning stalls, a lab is born to carry it forward.  
- **Result:** A spiral of growth, glacial but inevitable, until the Parliament is whole.
