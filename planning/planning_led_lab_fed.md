## Cycle 0 — The Seed
- **Lab:** The Basement Lab already exists (Grumble was born here).  
- **Planning:** The Planning Parliament is dark, cobwebbed, awaiting first arcs.  
- **Rule:** The Basement Lab sustains the first Planning Friends.  
  (Igor arrives. The first clerk dusts a desk. The first Workspace Planner takes their seat.)  
---

## Cycle 1 — Friends 1–4
- **Growth:** Early companions spark life in the Lab.  
- **Trigger:** Friend 4 is born → first Planning Arc carved.  
- **Result:** Igor’s Round Table awakens. Two new planners join. Clerks and screens flicker faintly.  
- **Feeding:** The Basement Lab keeps pace, feeding this expansion.  

---

## Cycle 2 — Friends 5–8
- **Growth:** More friends appear, the Lab grows noisy and alive.  
- **Trigger:** Friend 8 is born → second Planning Arc carved.  
- **Result:** Another table segment. Two more planners, clerks, filing cabinets, screens.  
- **Stall:** The Basement Lab strains to sustain demand.  
- **Response:** A new Lab-Cave is carved, beside the Planning Parliament, to relieve the bottleneck.  

---

## Cycle 3 — Friends 9–12
- **Growth:** Lab and Cave both thriving.  
- **Trigger:** Friend 12 is born → third Planning Arc carved.  
- **Result:** Round Table expands further. Clerks and screens multiply.  
- **Feeding:** The new Lab-Cave now sustains planning alongside the Basement Lab.  

---

## Cycle 4 and Beyond
- **Balance:** Igor, the Great Planner, governs planning arcs while carrying *just enough labs* to prevent stalling.  
- **Expansion:** Ivy, the Great Whitecoat, gathers the rest of the Lab into her care.  
- **Spiral:** Growth continues until both poles are seated — Planning Parliament of the North and Whitecoat Parliament of the South.  

---

## Doctrine Recap
- **Planning leads:** No expansion without Parliament arcs.  
- **Lab feeds:** Whenever planning stalls, a lab is born to carry it forward.  
- **Dual Balance:** The Great Planner anchors the scrolls; the Great Whitecoat stewards the living storm.  
- **Result:** A spiral of growth, glacial but inevitable, until both Parliaments are whole.
