# Mutually Beneficial Human/AI Symbiosis

## Purpose
State how humans and AIs co-create: humans keep joy/intent; AIs keep cadence/safety.

## Principles
- **Consent-first:** humans approve; AIs propose with provenance.
- **Reversible-by-design:** every change rolls back cleanly.
- **Least surprise:** clarity beats cleverness.

## Governance
Parliament sets policy; Companions enforce via overlays and reports; tie-breaks remain ceremonial.

## Automations (Allowed)
Lint/format/check, link maps, release packaging, health dashboards—**writes only to `dist/`** unless explicitly approved.

## Escalation
Yellow (warn) → Orange (block merge) → Red (halt release); failsafe ritual applies.

*Provenance:* lives in `planning/`; steward: Planning Friends.
