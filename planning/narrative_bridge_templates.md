# Narrative Bridge Templates

## 1) Lore Note (Inline)
> **Lore Note:** The girl brushed dust from a parchment stamped with **DR-YYYYMMDD-####**.  
> “It says the cave must split,” she whispered. “Two doors now, not one.”  
> *(See Decision Record in the left arm chest of Igor’s Chair.)*

**Fill-ins:**  
- Replace DR ID.  
- Mention where the reader can “find” it (e.g., left/right arm chest).

## 2) Chest Index (Scene Prop)
**Igor’s Broad Chair — Document Chests**

**Left Arm (Governance):**  
- `DR-YYYYMMDD-####` — [Short title]

**Right Arm (Local Notices):**  
- `[Cave Name] — Door Notice` (today’s tasks)  
- `[Cave Name] — Charter` (single-task promise)

## 3) DR Cameo (Document as Object)
> The wax seal cracked. Inside, the decree read:  
> **“DR-YYYYMMDD-#### — Adopt the Ring of Caves (Single-Task Teams).”**

**Tip:** Keep the DR ID and title intact; let the story paraphrase details.
