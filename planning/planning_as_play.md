## 1. Purpose
- Declare that planning files are not mere admin tools.  
- Preserve immersion by treating planning as part of the narrative world.  
- Guard against the temptation of “ordinary planning” that hollows out the myth.  
- Provide a competitive edge: no other project dares to make planning itself a game.  
---

## 2. Principles
- **Immersion:** Planning artifacts appear as story objects — chests, scrolls, decrees.  
- **Recursion:** Every decision document reflects and shapes the recursive structure of play.  
- **Difficulty = Uniqueness:** The harder path of planning-as-story is chosen because it yields a world unlike any other.  
- **Traceability:** Decisions (DRs) are woven into the lore, ensuring both narrative flavor and project clarity.  
- **No Separation:** There is no “outside the game” when consulting plans; the planning *is* gameplay.

## 3. Narrative Roles
- **Igor, the Great Planner** — keeper of planning chests, joker turned parliamentarian.  
- **Ivy, the Great Whitecoat** — builder of labs, shaper of friends, destined to sail south.  
- **The Lonely Doctor** — presides over both poles, ensuring planning and play remain intertwined.

## 4. Symbolism
- **Great Chair of Igor:** its arms are chests holding planning scrolls.  
- **Round Table:** not just furniture, but the living hub of cave captains.  
- **Parliament Scrolls:** charters and DRs, stamped with seals, carried in story scenes.  
- **Harbor of Hulks:** junk of the past re-forged into the furniture of planning, and later, ships of departure.

## 5. Competitive Edge
- Most projects treat planning as invisible overhead.  
- Making Friends AI turns planning into a **game feature**, a narrative device, and a recursive ritual.  
- This uniqueness is the moat that sets it apart in a crowded, fickle games industry.  

---

## 6. Provenance
- This doctrine lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It is referenced whenever doubt arises over why planning must be woven into story.  
- Companion scrolls:  
  - `planning/charter_of_the_poles.md`  
  - `planning/cavern_and_cave_model.md`  
  - `planning/transitional_stage.md`

*Thus, planning is play, and play is planning.  
The scrolls are not overhead — they are the game.  
This is the hard road, but also the unique road.  
And it is the only road worth walking.*
