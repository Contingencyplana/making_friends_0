# Harbor Of Hulks

## 1. Description

- A **great central sea cavern**, water-filled and cathedral vast.  
- Its ceiling and floor are pierced by the **Timestorm Generator Scepter**,  
  binding cavern, isle, and storm together.  
- **Fourteen outlets** ring its rim:  
  - **Thirteen Lesser Caverns** (twelve Workspaces + one Parliamentary Cavern).  
  - **One Sea Egress**, broad enough for hulks to pass into open waters.  
- **Rotting hulks** drift and creak against drowned piers.  
- Many lie **piled high with alien relics** — fragments of conquerors destroyed in a great sea battle.  
- Lanterns still gutter faintly, burning on forgotten alchemy and saltfire.

## 2. Narrative Roles

- **Doctor’s Genesis:**  
  - Born under a mere **Climate Curse**, the Doctor grew as calamity worsened.  
  - As a boy he watched the **Equatorial Ocean** fall to an alien fleet, humbling every land-power.  
  - As a youth, foreseeing disaster, he assembled the world’s greatest scavenger fleet.  
  - He led them into the **Alien Sea Battle**, hauling wrecks into this cavern despite storms born of a **Cascading Climate Cataclysm**.  
  - From here he marched inland to raise the Generator.  
  - But triumph curdled: his crews abandoned him, wary of his **commanding hand** and **unnatural studies**. Only his devoted assistants followed him into the Polar Fortress and its hidden **Basement Laboratory**.  

- **The Oath of the Assistants:**  
  - When a terrible accident claimed his aides, grief turned genius into obsession.  
  - He swore to restore them — especially **Ivy**, whose companionship had carried both promise and affection — once his craft could make the dead walk again.  
  - Their preservation marked the turning point from science toward **monstrous experiments**.  

- **Igor’s Transition:**  
  - Long after the Doctor’s Age, Igor, Grumble, and companions returned to the Harbor.  
  - Hulks were dismantled to craft the **Round Table and its chairs**.  
  - The **Parliamentary Cavern** became their chamber of debate — order coaxed from wreckage.  

- **Ivy’s Departure:**  
  - In her season, Ivy reclaimed the waters.  
  - She gathered a **fleet of refitted hulks**, made seaworthy once more.  
  - Southward they carried her, to found the **Second Hemisphere of Making Friends AI**.

## 3. Symbolism

- **Harbor = Axis:** primordial commons, center of both chaos and order.  
- **Hulks = Prototypes:** failures preserved, raw material for governance and fleets.  
- **Sea Egress = Recursion:** the open passage to other hemispheres and futures unknown.  
- **Scepter = Transfixion:** one line through hill, cavern, and sea — binding sky to underworld.  
- **Salt & Rot = Memory:** reminders that decay itself fuels renewal.

## 4. Provenance

- This file lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be referenced by:  
  - `planning/transitional_stage.md` (Igor’s rise and the furniture).  
  - `planning/charter_of_the_poles.md` (Doctor’s arrival, Ivy’s departure).  
  - Any future **Ship of Transition** scrolls.  
  - Any files mapping the **13+1 cavern structure**.  
- **See also:** `planning/fleet_of_scavengers.md` (the Lonely Doctor’s fleet and the alien sea battle that seeded the Harbor).

*Thus the Harbor of Hulks stands:  
where the Doctor’s fleet was moored,  
where Igor built the Round Table,  
and where Ivy will one day sail into the storm.*
