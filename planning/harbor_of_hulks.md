# Harbor of Hulks — Making Friends AI

This scroll records the lore and purpose of the **Harbor of Hulks**:  
a vast junkyard sea cavern beneath the isle, transfixed by the  
**Timestorm Generator Scepter**, and axis of three arcs —  
the Doctor’s arrival, Igor’s transition, and Ivy’s departure.

## 1. Description
- A **great central sea cavern**, water-filled and cathedral vast.  
- Its ceiling and floor are pierced by the **Timestorm Generator Scepter**,  
  binding cavern, isle, and storm together.  
- **Fourteen outlets** radiate from its rim:  
  - **Thirteen Lesser Caverns** (twelve Workspaces + one Parliamentary Cavern).  
  - **One Sea Egress**, large enough for hulks to pass into open waters.  
- **Rotting hulks** crowd the waters, creaking against drowned piers.  
- Many ships are **piled high with scavenged alien relics** —  
  wreckage of conquerors who destroyed themselves in a great sea battle.  
- Lanterns still gutter faintly, fed by forgotten alchemy and saltfire.

## 2. Narrative Roles
- **Doctor’s Genesis:**  
  - What had been a mere **Climate Curse** when the Lonely Doctor was born, worsened into a **Climate Calamity** as he blossomed into a child prodigy.  
  - As a young lad — at about the time the **Calamity** deepened into a **Climate Crisis** — the Doctor witnessed firsthand as an alien space fleet conquered the **Equatorial Ocean**. These aquatic aliens cared only for the sea, yet their swift victory shattered many cultures’ sense of superiority for decades.  
  - As a teenager — foreseeing what many did not, at about the time the **Crisis** was renamed a **Climate Catastrophe** — the Doctor assembled the greatest scavenger fleet the planet had ever seen.  
  - As a young adventurer, he grimly sailed toward the looming **Alien Sea Battle**.  
  - His flotilla gathered the alien wreckage — daring one of the continent-wide hurricanes that had begun to form at each pole, consequence of a **Cascading Climate Cataclysm** — and dragged a host of hulks into this cavern.  
  - From here, he marched inland to raise the Generator, leaving the hulks to rot.  
  - Yet once the Generator blazed, triumph soured: his once-adoring scavenger crews, weary of his **autocratic commands** and unnerved by his **monstrous experiments**, abandoned him. They left him the alien relics as his bitter share of the salvage — and withdrew in sturdy wooden submarines that slipped safely beneath the raging hurricane. Alone, the Doctor turned from the Harbor, trudging up through the **cave complex and honeycombed high hill**, into the very marrow of his storm-crowned **Polar Fortress**, until at last he sealed himself within the solitary sanctuary of his **Basement Laboratory**.

- **Igor’s Transition:**  
  - Igor, Grumble, and companions return here after the Doctor’s age.  
  - Hulks are scavenged to craft the **Round Table and chairs**.  
  - The Parliamentary Cavern (one of the thirteen) rises as their council chamber.  

- **Ivy’s Departure:**  
  - In time, Ivy will gather a new **fleet of refitted hulks**.  
  - Seaworthy again, they will bear her southward.  
  - Thus begins the founding of the **Second Hemisphere of Making Friends AI**.

## 3. Symbolism
- **Harbor = Axis:** primordial commons, center of both chaos and order.  
- **Hulks = Prototypes:** failures preserved, raw material for governance and fleets.  
- **Sea Egress = Recursion:** the open passage to other hemispheres and unknown futures.  
- **Scepter = Transfixion:** one line through hill, cavern, and sea — binding sky to underworld.  
- **Salt & Rot = Memory:** reminders that decay itself fuels renewal.

*Thus the Harbor of Hulks stands:  
where the Doctor’s fleet was moored,  
where Igor built the Round Table,  
and where Ivy will one day sail into the storm.*
