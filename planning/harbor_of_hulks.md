# Harbor of Hulks — Making Friends AI

This scroll records the lore and purpose of the **Harbor of Hulks**:  
a sea cavern beneath the isle, axis of three arcs —  
the Doctor’s arrival, Igor’s transition, and Ivy’s departure.

---

## 1. Description
- A vast **sea cavern** with an outlet to the stormy sea.  
- Docks swallowed by salt and time.  
- **Rotting hulks** line the harbor, creaking against stone piers.  
- Masts splinter like broken teeth, sails hang in tatters.  
- Many ships are **stacked to the gunwales with scavenged junk** —  
  remnants left over from forging the Timestorm Generator.  
- Lanterns still flicker faintly, fueled by forgotten alchemy.

## 2. Narrative Roles
- **Doctor’s Genesis:**  
  - The Lonely Doctor first landed here, a valiant young adventurer.  
  - From this harbor he marched inland to raise the Generator.  

- **Igor’s Transition:**  
  - Igor, Grumble, and their companions return here.  
  - Hulks are scavenged to craft the **Round Table and chairs**.  
  - The Harbor becomes a crucible for the Planning Parliament.  

- **Ivy’s Departure:**  
  - In time, Ivy will gather a small **fleet of hulks**.  
  - Refitted and seaworthy, they will carry her southward.  
  - Thus begins the founding of the **Second Half of Making Friends AI**.

## 3. Symbolism
- **Harbor = Axis:** connects past, present, and future.  
- **Hulks = Prototypes:** broken vessels become raw material for councils and fleets.  
- **Sea Outlet = Recursion:** the open door to other hemispheres, other phases.  
- **Salt & Rot = Memory:** failures preserved as scaffolding for new growth.

## 4. Provenance
- This file lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be referenced by:  
  - `planning/transitional_stage.md` (Igor’s rise and the furniture).  
  - `planning/charter_of_the_poles.md` (Doctor’s arrival, Ivy’s departure).  
  - Any future **Ship of Transition** scrolls.

*Thus the Harbor of Hulks stands:  
where the Doctor came ashore,  
where Igor built the Round Table,  
and where Ivy will one day sail into the storm.*
