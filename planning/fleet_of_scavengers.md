# Fleet of Scavengers — Making Friends AI

This scroll records the legend of the **Fleet of Scavengers**:  
the Lonely Doctor’s youthful armada, born of ruin,  
that stripped the planet’s alien wrecks and delivered hulks  
into the **Harbor of Hulks**, foundation of his storm-crowned **Polar Fortress**.

---

## 1. Description
- The **greatest scavenger fleet** the planet ever saw.  
- Comprised of patched ships, barges, hulks, and rafts —  
  built from the wreckage of an alien armada that once  
  conquered the seas, then annihilated itself in battle.  
- Crews were wanderers, tinkerers, and opportunists,  
  bound by the Doctor’s charisma and unyielding purpose.  
- Their holds brimmed with **alien steel, storm-forged crystals,  
  and impossible machinery**, scavenged from battlefields.  
- All spoils were funneled into the Harbor of Hulks,  
  the sea-gate and marrow of the wider **Polar Fortress**,  
  where ships themselves were left to rot once emptied.

## 2. Narrative Roles
- **Doctor’s Youthful Arc:**  
  - As a bold adventurer, the **Lonely Doctor** took command of the scavenger fleet.  
  - He rallied crews from shattered coasts, teaching them to wrest treasure from alien ruin.  
  - Their mission: strip the dead conquerors so the living could rebuild.  

- **The Great Alien Sea Battle:**  
  - Alien fleets fought until none remained — a storm of fire and thunder that cracked the horizon.  
  - Wrecks littered the seas, floating graveyards of a war that consumed its makers.  
  - The Doctor’s fleet descended after the carnage, scavenging what the aliens left behind.  

- **Legacy in the Harbor:**  
  - Hulks too broken for the fleet were dragged into the **Harbor of Hulks**.  
  - As the lowest chamber of the **Polar Fortress**, it became both junkyard and treasury.  
  - Their bones became Igor’s Round Table, Ivy’s future fleet, and endless prototypes.

## 3. Symbolism
- **Fleet = Youthful Ambition:** the Doctor’s fire before governance tempered him.  
- **Aliens = Hubris:** conquerors who destroyed themselves, leaving wreckage behind.  
- **Battle = Cleansing Storm:** devastation that cleared space for new builders.  
- **Scavenging = Renewal:** even ruin can fuel invention, if guided with purpose.  
- **Harbor = Memory:** the fleet’s final gift, anchoring the Parliament-to-come.  
- **Polar Fortress = Totality:** all spoils, caverns, hill, and house fused into one storm-crowned edifice.

## 4. Provenance
- This file lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be cross-linked with:  
  - `planning/harbor_of_hulks.md` (Hulks dragged into the Harbor).  
  - `planning/transitional_stage.md` (Doctor’s past as seed for Igor’s rise).  
  - `planning/charter_of_the_poles.md` (Doctor’s role in the planetary saga).  
- Future scrolls may reference the **Sea of Memory** or **Battle of Ruin**  
  when tracing the alien war’s echoes.  
- **See also:** `planning/harbor_of_hulks.md` (the Harbor where the fleet’s spoils came to rest, foundation of the Polar Fortress).

*Thus the Fleet of Scavengers sails still in story:  
a thousand patched hulls, lanterns guttering on alien decks,  
the Lonely Doctor standing at the prow,  
charting a course through ruin into legend.*
