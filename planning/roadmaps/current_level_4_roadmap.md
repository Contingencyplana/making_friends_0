# Current Level 4 Roadmap — The Scribe’s Daily Ledger

This scroll records the **daily ledger**, where each note becomes lived reality.  
Every entry is a day’s toil, a spark in the storm, a line in Igor’s broad chest.  

---

## Rules of this Scroll
- One **active ledger line** at a time (the day’s work is upon it).  
- Lines not yet begun may be **added, edited, or replaced** at will.  
- Completed lines are **crossed and archived**, never rewritten.

## Ledger under Note 1.1.1
*(Awaiting the first daily line…)*  

---

*Thus the days are marked, one line at a time, until the ledger is full and a new scroll begun.*
