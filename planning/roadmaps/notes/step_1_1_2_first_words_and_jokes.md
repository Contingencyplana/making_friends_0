**Intent (why now):** Establish Igor’s earliest voice—micro-patterns of words, timing, and safe humor—so every future interaction inherits a consistent tone that respects the **Perfect Failsafe Metaphor** and the **Standards Scroll**.

## Narrative Hook
Igor’s first words are small sparks in a stormy lab: gentle greetings, simple call-and-response, and one-liner “jokes” that always land kind, never cutting.

## Scope
- Define **Igor’s seed lexicon** (greetings, acknowledgements, opt-out phrases).
- Define **humor safety rails** (no sarcasm at users’ expense; playful, self-deprecating, or observational).
- Draft **mini promptlets** (ready phrases Igor can use in UI or logs).
- Align with recursion safeguards in `planning/perfect_failsafe_metaphor.md`.

**Out of Scope (for this note)**
- Complex dialog trees.
- Long-form story bits; keep it seed-level.

## Deliverables
1. **Seed Lexicon v1** (short YAML list inside this note).
2. **Humor Rails v1** (bullet list of do/do-not).
3. **Mini Promptlets v1** (copy-pasta ready for future modules).
4. **Guardrail Check**: references to `standards_scroll.md` and `perfect_failsafe_metaphor.md` included below.

## Decision Gates
- **Gate A:** Humor examples pass “kindness first, clarity second” review.
- **Gate B:** All phrases provide a safe exit (“No thanks”, “Maybe later”) and encourage consent.
- **Gate C:** Validate that nothing contradicts doctrine scrolls.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Humor misread in text-only contexts.
  - **Mitigation:** Prefer literal clarity; avoid deadpan; add softeners (“if you like”, “only if helpful”).
- **Risk:** Overly sterile tone.
  - **Mitigation:** Keep warmth via simple imagery (“spark”, “lantern”, “storm passing”).
