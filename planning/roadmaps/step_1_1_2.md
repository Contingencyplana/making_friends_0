# Step 1.1.2 — Motions

## The Notes under Motion 1.1.2

- **Step 1.1.2.1 — Seed Lexicon** — *Status: complete*  
  Igor’s first working vocabulary: greetings, acknowledgements, and safe confirmations.  
  Note: `planning/roadmaps/notes/step_1_1_2_1_seed_lexicon.md`

- **Step 1.1.2.2 — Humor Rails** — *Status: drafting*  
  Boundaries for kind, safe, and readable humor aligned with the **Perfect Failsafe Metaphor** and the **Standards Scroll**.  
  Note: `planning/roadmaps/notes/step_1_1_2_2_humor_rails.md`

---

## Provenance
- This roadmap replaces Step **1.1.1** (Genesis of Igor), now archived under `planning/archive/year2025/sept/`.  
- It tracks the active Level 3 notes beneath **Step 1.1.2** of the Level 1 roadmap.  
- When all notes here are complete, archive this scroll and open the next Step under Decree **1.1**.

*Thus Igor’s first sparks are not only strange, but kind:  
words that flicker with humor and light the Parliament’s path.*

## Operational Guardrails (for this roadmap)

- **Immutable IDs:** Keep numeric paths stable (1.1 → 1.1.2). Rename titles only.  
- **Front-matter:**  

```yaml
id: 1.1.2
kind: roadmap
owners: [planning]
status: active
```

- **Sharding & Archives:** Move completed/large sections to `planning/archive/<year>/...` and leave a pointer.  
- **Index READMEs:** Each major folder keeps a short `README.md` with 5–15 key links + one-line blurbs.  
- **Link Aliases:** Maintain canonical redirects in `planning/_aliases.md` to avoid broken references.  
- **Validation:** Run link check, seed lexicon ↔ code check, and humor rails validation before each release.  
- **Decision Records:** Any step change gets a DR (e.g., `planning/dr/DR-0008.md`) linked from the line.  
- **Failsafe:** If any guardrail conflicts with delivery, defer the change and invoke the  
  _Perfect Failsafe Metaphor_ (`planning/perfect_failsafe_metaphor.md`) to stage a safe transition.  
- **See also:** `planning/standards/operations.md` for the living, detailed version of these rules.
