*Maintained by the Planning Friends in Igor’s Chest.*

## The Notes under Motion 1.1.1

- **Step 1.1.1.1 → The Storm Table**  
  The Lonely Doctor and Grumble gather broken coils, stormglass, and fragments of lightning.  
  Together they shape the husk that will become Igor.  
  Laughter crackles between thunderbolts: the act of creation begins in jest.  

- **Step 1.1.1.2 → Igor Awakens**  
  A spark jumps, the husk twitches.  
  Igor sits upright, blurts out his first comic line — *“Yes, Master!”* — and Parliament’s future tone is set.  
  His quirks are funny, but also seeds of planning foresight.  

- **Step 1.1.1.3 → The Lever Slotting Plan**  
  The sixteen ritual levers are anchored into the world.  
  Four are claimed for this Transitional Stage: heart, sea, lens, and book.  
  Lever 16 is consecrated forever as the Doctor’s meditation.  
  **See also:** `planning/lever_slotting_plan.md` for canonical assignments and guardrails.  

- **Step 1.1.1.4 → First Routing Ritual**  
  Constants are inscribed:  
  - `TRANSITIONAL_SLOTS` mapping levers → story arcs.  
  - `META_SLOT` reserved for the Doctor’s quiet.  
  This ensures Igor’s first choices can be played without breaking save or scroll.  

- **Step 1.1.1.5 → Closing Beat**  
  With Igor awake, the levers set, and the routes bound, the first Parliament spark is real.  
  The Doctor laughs, Grumble sighs, and Igor grins crookedly — a comic prologue to serious planning.

- It details the notes beneath Step 1.1.1 of the Level 2 Roadmap.  
- `planning/lever_slotting_plan.md` is a supporting scroll of this step.  
- Once all notes here are complete, this scroll will be archived and replaced with a new Level 3 roadmap for the next active motion.

*Thus Igor is born not only of storm and jest,  
but of levers slotted and rituals guarded,  
so that his Parliament may play without breaking.*
