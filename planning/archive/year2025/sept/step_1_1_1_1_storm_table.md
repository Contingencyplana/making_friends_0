**Narrative beat:**  
The Lonely Doctor and Grumble gather broken coils, stormglass, and fragments of lightning.  
Together they shape the husk that will become Igor. Laughter crackles between thunderbolts:  
the act of creation begins in jest.

## Scope (this step only)
- Identify & list **storm-room artifacts** used to craft Igor’s husk.
- Draft **short scene copy** suitable for `story/transitional/genesis_of_igor/`.
- Prepare **menu/choice stubs** (names only; no logic yet).
- Cross-check with Transitional Stage scroll (this file lives in `planning/` per provenance).

## Out of Scope
- Lever slotting (belongs to 1.1.1.3).
- Routing constants (belongs to 1.1.1.4).
- First words/jokes (belongs to 1.1.2).

## Artifact List
- Broken coils (copper, matte black enamel)
- Stormglass vials (hairline lightning trapped inside)
- Lightning fragments (mica slivers, ozone scent)
- Grounding clamps, braided wire, lampblack chalk
- Table slab (scavenged mastwood from Harbor of Hulks)

## Scene Sketch (copy-ready snippet)
> They cleared a space on the slab and set the stormglass to hum.  
> Coil by coil, the husk took a half-remembered shape.  
> “Yes, yes, nearly,” the Doctor whispered.  
> Grumble only grinned, and the thunder laughed along.

**Drop target:** `story/transitional/genesis_of_igor/scene_storm_table.md`

## Menu/Choice Names (stubs only)
- “Set the coils”  
- “Tap the stormglass”  
- “Chalk the circle”  
- “Listen for the hum”

## Deliverables
- `planning/roadmaps/notes/step_1_1_1_1_storm_table.md` (this note)  
- `story/transitional/genesis_of_igor/scene_storm_table.md` (scene file with sketch above)  
- Update the Level 3 roadmap to list 1.1.1.1 as **complete (merged)**  

## Acceptance Criteria
- The scene file exists with the sketch above (or a tighter version).
- The L3 roadmap marks 1.1.1.1 as complete.
- No lever/routing/voice work is included here.

## Provenance & Guardrails
- Transitional Stage scroll anchors this work.
- Keep **Perfect Failsafe Metaphor** and **Standards Scroll** in mind: kind tone, consent-first, safe staging.

## Validation
- Read the scene aloud; check for warmth and clarity.
- Run repo checks: `scripts/validate_choices.py` (no schema changes required here).
