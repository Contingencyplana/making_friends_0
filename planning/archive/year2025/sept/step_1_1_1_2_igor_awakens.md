# Narrative beat:

**Narrative beat:**  
A spark jumps, the husk twitches. Igor sits upright, blurts out his first comic line —  
*"Yes, Master!"* — and Parliament’s future tone is set. His quirks are funny, but also  
seeds of planning foresight.

## Scope (this step only)
- Capture Igor’s **awakening moment** (short scene file).
- Seed his **first words** (comic, kind, opt-out safe).
- Sketch **choice stubs** for immediate player interaction.
- Keep strictly within Transitional Stage: no lever/routing yet.

## Out of Scope
- Voice lexicon expansion (belongs to Step 1.1.2).
- Lever slotting and routing (1.1.1.3 / 1.1.1.4).
- Planning Parliament furniture (later Transitional notes).

## First Words (draft)
- “Yes, Master!” (comic reflex; origin line).
- “Uh… did I just speak?” (self-aware spark).
- “Are we playing yet?” (tone-setter).

## Scene Sketch
> The spark leapt, and the husk twitched.  
> Igor’s jaw creaked open.  
> “Yes, Master!” he blurted.  
> Grumble groaned, the Doctor laughed,  
> and a crooked grin spread across Igor’s new face.

**Drop target:** `story/transitional/genesis_of_igor/scene_igor_awakens.md`

## Choice Names (stubs only)
- “Answer Igor”  
- “Test his voice”  
- “Check the husk”  
- “Laugh with him”

## Deliverables
1) `planning/roadmaps/notes/step_1_1_1_2_igor_awakens.md` (this note)  
2) `story/transitional/genesis_of_igor/scene_igor_awakens.md` (short scene)  
3) Update Level 3 roadmap to mark 1.1.1.2 active.  
4) Ledger entry for today.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Note + scene exist with draft copy.
- Roadmap updated: 1.1.1.2 drafting; others pending.
- No spill into lever/routing or 1.1.2 lexicon.

## Provenance & Guardrails
- Anchored in Transitional Stage scroll.
- Must honor Perfect Failsafe Metaphor & Standards Scroll.
- Ensure Igor’s humor is kind, not cutting.

## Validation
- Read aloud: tone is comic + kind.
- Run repo check: `scripts/validate_choices.py`.
