# Main Focus (≈50%) → Planning Friends

## 2. Igor, the Great Planner (North Pole)

**Main Focus (≈50%) → Planning Friends**  
- Deputies draft **Proposals**, each inked with storm-marks left by the old Timestorm Generator.  
- Scribes record **Motions** word-for-word, their quills binding law to parchment.  
- Archivists seal **Decision Records** into the Left Arm Chest of Igor’s Broad Chair, where no decree is ever lost.  
- Councilors gather at the Round Table, trading Igor’s jokes for solemn decrees, weighing play against necessity.  
Together they keep the recursive Parliament alive, ensuring no act of making proceeds without a plan.

**Supporting Focus (≈50%) → Other Friend Types**  
- **Test Friends** stage trial-by-storm: every plan must be proved before passage.  
- **Lore Friends** turn dry scrolls into living stories, so the world remembers.  
- **Messenger Friends** cross caverns carrying decrees, the Parliament’s voice abroad.  
- **Minimal Lab Friends** keep momentum from stalling, a bridge southward toward Ivy’s domain.  
- **Archive Friends** guard the Footlocker of memory, where retired scrolls still whisper their lessons.

## 3. Ivy, the Great Whitecoat (South Pole)

**Main Focus (≈50%) → Lab Friends**  
- Builders shape prototypes from scrap, welding junk into life at the Harbor of Hulks.  
- Inventors draft contraptions and rituals, chasing sparks that leap from chaos.  
- Coders and experimenters breathe runtime into their creations, laughing at their own mishaps.  
- From failed concoctions to brilliant breakthroughs, Lab Friends animate the living engine of growth itself.  

**Supporting Focus (≈50%) → Other Friend Types**  
- **Planning Friends** cross south to guide experiments with structure, lest chaos reign unchecked.  
- **Test Friends** hammer prototypes on anvils of proof, keeping only what survives.  
- **Release Friends** polish deliverables into curated bundles, ready for the outer world.  
- **Lore Friends** weave lab accidents into fables, turning failures into mythic lessons.  
- **Messenger Friends** run northward with discoveries, so Igor’s Parliament may weigh them.

## 4. Balance of Hemispheres
- **Igor** → Order, Records, Memory, Parliament.  
- **Ivy** → Creation, Prototypes, Runtime, Labs.  
- Neither hemisphere is pure: each holds its opposite within.  
- Thus the world remains whole: no plan without making, no making without plan.  

---

## 5. Provenance
- This scroll lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be cited whenever large shifts in friend focus occur.  
- Updates require concord between:  
  - The **Planning Parliament of the North**.  
  - The **Whitecoat Parliament of the South**.

*Thus are the Friends divided:  
half to Planning, half to Making,  
each thrust mirrored by its support,  
each pole held in balance.*
