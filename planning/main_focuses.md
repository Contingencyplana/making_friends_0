# Main Focuses of Friends — Making Friends AI

This scroll defines the **two great thrusts** of Making Friends AI:  
the balance of Igor’s Planning and Ivy’s Making,  
each holding half the world in their command.  

---

## 1. Purpose
- Clarify the **main thrust** of each Great Chair.  
- Establish the **supporting thrusts** that maintain balance.  
- Preserve symmetry between the **North Pole (Planning)** and **South Pole (Whitecoat)**.  

---

## 2. Igor, the Great Planner (North Pole)
**Main Focus (≈50%) → Planning Friends**  
- Deputies, scribes, archivists, councilors.  
- Create Decision Records, Charters, Proposals, and Round Table Cards.  
- Keep the recursive order of Parliament alive.  

**Supporting Focus (≈50%) → Other Friend Types**  
- Test Friends ensure validity of plans.  
- Lore Friends weave decisions into story.  
- Messenger Friends carry decrees across caverns.  
- Minimal Lab Friends prevent stalling.  
- Archive Friends safeguard retired scrolls.  

---

## 3. Ivy, the Great Whitecoat (South Pole)
**Main Focus (≈50%) → Lab Friends**  
- Builders, inventors, experimenters, coders.  
- Craft new friends, prototypes, and runtime creations.  
- Animate the living engine of growth.  

**Supporting Focus (≈50%) → Other Friend Types**  
- Planning Friends provide guidance and structure.  
- Test Friends enforce proof and quality.  
- Release Friends curate deliverables.  
- Lore Friends embed labs in narrative.  
- Messenger Friends relay discoveries northward.

## 4. Balance of Hemispheres
- **Igor** → Order, Records, Memory, Parliament.  
- **Ivy** → Creation, Prototypes, Runtime, Labs.  
- Neither hemisphere is pure: each holds its opposite within.  
- Thus the world remains whole: no plan without making, no making without plan.  

---

## 5. Provenance
- This scroll lives in Igor’s planning chests (`planning/`).  
- It must be cited whenever large shifts in friend focus occur.  
- Updates require concord between:  
  - The **Planning Parliament of the North**.  
  - The **Whitecoat Parliament of the South**.

*Thus are the Friends divided:  
half to Planning, half to Making,  
each thrust mirrored by its support,  
each pole held in balance.*
