# Document Chests Contract (Canon)

This contract defines how planning and governance artifacts are woven into the story world of Making Friends AI.  
It distinguishes **policy** (this file) from **templates** (see `planning/narrative_bridge_templates.md`).

---

## 1. The Broad Chair & Its Chests
- **Left Arm Chest — Governance**  
  Holds the Planning Parliament’s scrolls: **Proposals, Motions, Decision Records (DRs), Minutes**.  

- **Right Arm Chest — Local Notices**  
  Holds cave-level artifacts: **Door Notices, Cave Charters, Round Table Cards**.  

- **Optional Compartments**  
  - *Seat Drawer — Releases Ledger*: hashes, notes, DR references.  
  - *Footlocker — Archive*: superseded DRs, retired notices.  

---

## 2. Narrative Bridge Rules
- Every overarching planning file must be reachable through at least one **Lore Note** or **Chest Index** in-story.  
- Parliament artifacts (DRs, Proposals, Motions, Minutes) are always stored in the **Left Arm Chest**.  
- Local cave planning (Door Notices, Charters) are always stored in the **Right Arm Chest**.  
- Round Table Cards appear in-story at the council scene, but are also indexed here.  

---

## 3. Provenance
- **Traceability**: each Decision Record (DR) must cite drafts, proposals, and motions that preceded it.  
- **Release linkage**: each release zip notes the DR-IDs that changed scope.  
- **Archival**: superseded DRs and retired notices move to the Footlocker but remain referenceable.
