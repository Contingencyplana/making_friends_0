The Parliament of Friends is bicameral and symmetrical:

- **North Pole (Igor’s Parliament)** — **15 seats**  
  - **3 officer seats** in the Planning Parliament Cavern  
  - **12 workspace seats** mapped to VS Code workspaces
- **South Pole (Ivy’s Parliament)** — **15 seats**  
  - **3 officer seats** in the Whitecoat Parliament Cavern  
  - **12 workspace seats** mapped to VS Code workspaces

**Grand Parliament (joint session)** = 30 seated votes.  
**The Lonely Doctor** serves as the **tie-breaker (31st vote when required)** and does not hold a permanent seat.

> Officers do **not** add more workspaces. We still maintain **24 workspaces** total (12 per pole).  
> The Parliament Cavern in each hemisphere is represented by one of the 12 workspaces (N6/S6 below).

## The Lonely Doctor (Tie-Breaker)
- Attends **Grand Parliament** joint sessions **only when a vote is tied (15–15)**.  
- Casts the **deciding vote**.  
- Holds **no permanent seat** and **no dedicated workspace**.

---

## Totals & Structure
- **Seats:** 15 (North) + 15 (South) = **30** seated votes  
- **Tie-breaker:** Lonely Doctor → **31st vote when needed**  
- **Workspaces:** **24** (12 per pole, including the Parliament Cavern workspace in each pole)  
- **Caverns:** **26** total (12 per pole + 2 Parliament Caverns)

The Grand Parliament is thus balanced, playable, and decisive:  
two hemispheres in harmony, with the founding Doctor as the final hinge.
