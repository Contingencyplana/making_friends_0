The Parliament of Friends is bicameral:  
- **North Pole (Igor’s Hemisphere)** — 12 seats + Planning Parliament Cavern.  
- **South Pole (Ivy’s Hemisphere)** — 12 seats + Whitecoat Parliament Cavern.  

Together these form the **24-seat Grand Parliament**, presided over by Igor (North) and Ivy (South).  
Each seat is anchored to a VS Code workspace (`making_friends_X`).  
Each hemisphere has a 13th cavern which houses its Parliament chamber.
