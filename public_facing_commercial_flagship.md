- ðŸ¤– **Friends with personality** â†’ each folder is a cyberfriend with a soul.  
- ðŸ˜‚ **Whimsy and humor** â†’ Igor laughs, Grumble groans, others surprise you.  
- ðŸŽ­ **Player agency** â†’ every choice spawns new files, shaping the lab itself.  

## Why It Matters

- Itâ€™s **commercially viable**: easy to demo, stream, and crowdfund.
