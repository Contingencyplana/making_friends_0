# INDEX — The Sixteen

Map of levers (current + planned).  
1..15 → friend routes (content)  
16 → Meditation (Save / Quit / Back to Round Table)

---

## Notes
- Each lever opens a potential path into a **cave** (single-task team).  
- Lever 16 is special: it opens the **Meditation menu**, which also serves as a meta exit back to the **Planning Parliament / Round Table**.  
- Add entries per lever as they gain behavior.
