# Scene: The Storm Table

The lamp flickers like a nervous moth. Ozone bites the back of the tongue. Leather straps
release a faint heat into a slab that steals it back. The Lonely Doctor hovers, sleeves
rolled, eyes bright with calculation; Grumble counts sparks on his fingers and loses track
at the thumb, then starts again with dignity. Coils thrum in the ribs of the chassis until
the room hums along. Tools rattle in their tray as if they want roles.

“Sparks ready, Master,” Grumble reports, proud of the arithmetic he just re-negotiated.

“On my mark,” the Doctor murmurs, tapping a rhythm no one taught him. “Three, two—”

A pale moth scribbles circles on the lamp glass. Somewhere under the leather and brass, a
fresh mind listens for its first idea, practicing the shape of yes. The air smells like tea
left on too long and a storm that made other plans. If there were a bell, it would be polite
and ominous at once.

The second heart taps once, then waits.
