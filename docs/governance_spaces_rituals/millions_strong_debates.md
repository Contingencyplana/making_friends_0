# Millions-Strong Debates

**Purpose.** Define how vast assemblies of Doctors can speak, listen, and vote in the Junkyard Sea Cavern without chaos.  
The system balances scale, equity, and ceremony so that millions can gather yet still feel heard.

## 1) Core Principles

- **Equity.** Every Doctor may request the floor; visibility is earned, not bought.  
- **Scalability.** Debates function smoothly whether dozens or millions attend.  
- **Ceremony.** Speaking feels mythic: lantern lifts, cavern echoes, luminous tallies.  
- **Safety.** Tone guided by Civility Charter; failsafes pause proceedings when needed.

## 2) Floor Access (Ranked Queue)

- **Request Speak.** Any Doctor may enter the queue with a topic tag.  
- **Floor Score.** Composite of:
  - Reputation (service history, teaching, constructive presence).  
  - Motion relevance (alignment with current debate).  
  - Audience votes (upvotes, time donations).  
- **Transparency.** Queue order and scores visible to all.

## 3) Speaking Rights

- **Time Boxes.**  
  - General: 30–60 seconds  
  - Panelists: 120 seconds  
  - Sponsors/Chairs: 180 seconds  
- **Time Donations.** Doctors may gift unused time to others.  
- **Amplification.** Applause, votes, or motifs can extend a turn within limits.  
- **Civility Charter.** Address others by title + adjective (“Doctor Radiant”), not by person.

## 4) Sharding & Scale

- **Micro-Stages.** The cavern shards into synchronized clusters, each with its own mini-stage.  
- **Aggregation.** Top speakers per shard feed into the Grand Grotto stage.  
- **Signal Wall.** Screens display a rotating mosaic of shards; players can hop views.  
- **Synchronization.** Core motions and tallies propagate globally in real time.

## 5) Voting & Outcomes

- **Vote Types.**  
  - Simple Majority (routine).  
  - Supermajority (constitutional).  
  - Consensus Call (ritual remembrances, ceremonies).  
- **Display.** Luminous tally arcs above stages; tied votes trigger ceremonial pauses.  
- **Tie-Breaks.** Only resolved in Parliament, not in the Cavern (see `parliament_protocol.md`).  
- **Patch Notes.** All results auto-published as artifacts with transcript excerpts.

## 6) Moderation & Marshals

- **Companion Marshals.** AI companions guide queues, highlight civility, route petitions.  
- **Elected Facilitators.** Human Doctors can serve as moderators; rotation prevents entrenchment.  
- **Safety Escalation.** Calming failsafe pauses all shards; resumes only on majority consent.

---

## 7) Accessibility & Inclusion

- **Captions.** Default, multi-language, adjustable speed and size.  
- **Sign Inset.** Persistent windows near shard stages.  
- **Low Bandwidth Mode.** Audio + transcript-only participation.  
- **Sensory Settings.** Control visual effects, motion, and sound separately.

---

## 8) KPIs (Debate Health)

- **Median Wait.** ≤10 minutes at 95th percentile load.  
- **Equity.** Gini coefficient of speaking time trending downward.  
- **Safety.** Failsafe activation reduces toxicity/error within 10 minutes.  
- **Participation.** % of attendees who cast at least one vote (>70% target).  
- **Replay Value.** % who revisit transcripts or patch notes within 24h.

## 9) Design Intent

Millions-Strong Debates are playful cathedrals of discourse:  
structured enough to stay safe and fair, loose enough for wit, banter, and spectacle.  
They turn scale into ceremony, ensuring the Great Timestorm remains vibrant and humane.
