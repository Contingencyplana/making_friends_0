# Parliament Protocol — North & South Poles

**Purpose.** Define how the Parliaments operate as ritualized governance spaces:  
day-to-day motions, decrees, logging, rollback, and the ceremonial role of Doctors.

---

## 1. Structure

- **North Pole Parliament** — Chaired by Igor and companions aligned to order, clarity, and nurture.  
- **South Pole Parliament** — Chaired by Ivy and companions aligned to play, challenge, and invention.  
- **Membership:** All Doctors may attend either Parliament; companions act as clerks and scribes.  
- **Agenda:** Maintained as a scroll; motions queued in order of proposal.  

---

## 2. Motion Types

- **Minor Motion** — Simple housekeeping, single-timeline scope.  
- **Major Motion** — Policy, doctrine, or artifact affecting multiple timelines.  
- **Emergency Motion** — Urgent repair or failsafe; requires supermajority.  

---

## 3. Voting Rules

- **Quorum:** 3 Doctors minimum (local), 7+ (joint/federated).  
- **Vote Types:**  
  - *Simple Majority* → Minor Motions.  
  - *Supermajority (≥66%)* → Major Motions.  
  - *Emergency (≥80%)* → Emergency Motions.  
- **Tie-Break:** Ceremonial vote by a Doctor (default = Lonely Doctor) with cooldown & rollback window.  

---

## 4. Logging & Transparency

- **Parliament Journal:** Immutable scroll of all motions, votes, and results.  
- **Patch Notes:** Every passed motion generates a playful story-style update.  
- **Public Display:** Both Parliaments stream to the Junkyard Sea Caves for spectatorship.  

---

## 5. Rollback Windows

- **Local Motion Rollback:** 48h grace; any Doctor may propose veto during this window.  
- **Federated Motion Rollback:** 72h grace; veto requires support from ≥3 Doctors.  
- **Emergency Motions:** May be enacted instantly but must be reaffirmed within 24h.  

---

## 6. Ritual & Ceremony

- **Opening:** Bell rung by Igor/Ivy; parchment unfurled.  
- **Debate:** Doctors address each other by chosen adjectives (“Doctor Radiant, Doctor Curious...”).  
- **Closing:** Motion sealed with a symbolic stitch; companion clerk archives the record.  

---

## 7. Safety & Rate Limits

- **Tie-Break Cooldown:** 72h global; doubles if repeated on same topic.  
- **Emergency Frequency:** Max 1 emergency motion per Doctor per week.  
- **Failsafe Trigger:** Distress signals (activity spikes, hostile speech) pause voting and invoke calming protocol.  

---

## 8. Design Intent

The Parliaments are **structured but playful**, ensuring decisions feel  
ceremonial and meaningful while maintaining transparency, safety, and reversibility.  
Doctors mostly remain above/beyond the chambers, stepping in only when rituals demand it.
