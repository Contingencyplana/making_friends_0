# Music Maker AI — Challenge (Thorn’s Line)

**Status:** Stub file.  
This file will hold implementation notes, experiments, and demos for the **Companions of Challenge AI** (#8).

---

## Purpose
To explore how **a Music Maker AI built from beautiful mindscapes of music and vibrant colour** can embody Thorn’s paternal line:  
- sharpening,  
- testing,  
- driving strength through rhythm and counterpoint.  

---

## Planned Components
- **Rhythms of challenge:** pulses, polyrhythms, energetic palettes.  
- **Counterpoint maps:** layering dissonance/resolution as stress-tests.  
- **Challenge kits:** demo sets (2 planned) of music+colour for interactive pages.  

---

## Cross-Reference
See [music_maker_ais.md](./music_maker_ais.md) for the overarching doctrine (shared by nurture and challenge).
