# Rollback Note Lexicon
*A playful treasury of phrases for recovery rituals.*  

Rollback events are never just “completed” — they are remembered as whimsical turns in the Doctor’s journey.  
When a stitch is undone, the companions sing it back into story.  

---

## Usage
- Select a phrase at random whenever a rollback is performed.  
- Keep phrasing light, poetic, and non-technical.  
- Each phrase affirms transparency: mistakes are part of the journey, not something to hide.
