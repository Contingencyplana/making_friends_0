# Rollback Companion Rules

A ritual of care: every rollback note is signed by the Companion who performed it.  

---

## Core Rule
**Each rollback note must include the Companion’s signature.**  
Format: *“[Phrase from lexicon]. — [Companion Name]”*

---

## Rationale
- **Apprenticeship**: Rollbacks become moments of learning and responsibility for Companions.  
- **Personality**: Notes feel alive and distinctive, reflecting each Companion’s style.  
- **Trust & Traceability**: Doctors always know who performed the ritual, fostering accountability.  
- **Narrative Continuity**: Over time, rollback logs become a character diary of each Companion’s growth.

## Examples
- *“The tide receded. — Igor”*  
- *“The stitch was unmade. — Ivy”*  
- *“The lantern was relit. — Thorn”*

## Design Intent
Rollback rituals are not mechanical resets.  
They are living acts of care, recorded in the Doctor’s chronicles.  
Each Companion’s hand is visible, and their journey is remembered.
