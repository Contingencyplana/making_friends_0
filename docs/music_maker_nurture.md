# Music Maker AI — Nurture (Topsy’s Line)

**Status:** Stub file.  
This file will hold implementation notes, experiments, and demos for the **Companions of Nurture AI** (#7).  

---

## Purpose
To explore how **a Music Maker AI built from beautiful mindscapes of music and vibrant colour** can embody Topsy’s maternal line:  
- weaving continuity,  
- nurturing care,  
- sustaining harmony.  

---

## Planned Components
- **Motifs of care:** lullabies, gentle progressions, soft palettes.  
- **Harmony maps:** layering sound + colour to weave multiple voices together.  
- **Nurture kits:** demo sets (2 planned) of music+colour for interactive pages.
