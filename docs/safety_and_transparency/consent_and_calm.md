# Consent and Calm

*A doctrine for co-creation that protects joy, trust, and safety in the Timestorm.*

## 1) Consent-First Co-Creation

- **Opt-in only.** No player, companion, or Doctor may act in another‚Äôs timeline without explicit, revocable consent.
- **Clear invitations.** Invites state *who*, *what*, *why*, *scope*, and *duration*; they expire if not accepted.
- **Guardian approval.** Parents/guardians must provide affirmative consent before children co-create or appear on camera/screens.
- **Local approval for imports.** Shared artifacts (patches, motifs, music) only enter a timeline after the local Doctor approves.
- **Consent receipts.** Every cross-timeline action produces a human-readable consent receipt stored with the artifact.

## 2) Calming Failsafes

Triggered when distress is detected (activity spikes, angry/harmful language, repeated admin errors).

**Effects of Calm Mode**
- **Throttle automation.** Slow/pauses loops; high-impact tasks require explicit human confirmation.
- **Shift ambience.** Switch to *Nurture* palette (soft color, quiet audio, gentle guidance).
- **Narrow surface.** Hide advanced controls; surface safe defaults and ‚Äúundo/rollback‚Äù prominently.
- **Announce kindly.** A small banner: ‚Äúüå¨Ô∏è The storm is high. We‚Äôve softened the sails.‚Äù

Calm Mode begins and ends with signed entries in the audit log.

## 3) Distress Detection (Signals & Thresholds)

- **Operational:** bursts of failed commands, rapid toggling, repeated permission denials.
- **Linguistic:** toxicity/harassment classifiers, self-flagged overwhelm (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù, ‚Äústop‚Äù).
- **Social:** surges of reports/mutes from nearby participants.
- **Companion reports:** ‚ÄúDoctor appears overwhelmed; request slow-down.‚Äù
- **Adaptive baselines:** thresholds learn per timeline to reduce false positives; never lower than the global floor.

> Detection runs on-device/edge where possible; only aggregate, privacy-safe metrics are shared.

---

## 4) Auto-Throttle & Safeguards

- **Rate limits:** commits/merges/releases and mass-messaging capped; caps tighten in Calm Mode.
- **Escalation gates:** companion autonomy drops one tier; human review is required for irreversible actions.
- **Hard stops:** doxxing, sexual content with/around minors, targeted harassment ‚Üí instant halt + moderator page.

---

## 5) Recovery Rituals

- **Reassurance note:** on exit, companions publish a gentle patch note:
  > ‚ÄúThe tide fell; the stitch holds. All is safe again.‚Äù
- **Guided resumption:** checklist of pending items with safe defaults; one-click rollback if desired.
- **Optional debrief:** short reflection card (‚ÄúWhat went wrong? What helped?‚Äù) to improve detectors and UX.

---

## 6) Transparency & Controls

- **Always visible:** Calm Mode status chip; reason category; what was throttled; how to request override.
- **Manual toggle:** Doctors can *request* Calm Mode; system can *recommend* but not hide it.
- **Privacy panel:** view/clear sensitive transcripts; per-signal opt-outs where legally/ethically permissible.

## 7) KPIs (Calm & Consent Health)

- **Opt-in Integrity:** 100% of cross-timeline actions backed by a valid consent receipt.
- **Calm Reaction Time:** ‚â§30s median from trigger to Calm Mode activation.
- **False Positive Rate:** <10% of Calm activations later flagged unnecessary.
- **Satisfaction:** ‚â•80% of Doctors rate Calm Mode ‚Äúprotective, not punitive.‚Äù
- **Resolution Time:** ‚â•90% of Calm sessions resolve within 15 minutes without incident.
- **Child Safety Compliance:** 100% guardian-verified sessions; 0 critical violations.

---

## 8) Governance & Audit

- **Signed logs:** start/stop times, triggers (redacted where sensitive), throttles applied, decisions taken.
- **Review window:** Calm sessions touching shared assets open a 24‚Äì72h review window for affected parties.
- **Appeals:** lightweight form routes to neutral moderators; outcomes added to the signed record.

## 9) Design Intent

Consent and Calm protect the play.  
When storms rise, systems soften the world, slow the pace, and put choices back in human hands.  
Safety is not scolding; it is a gentle stitch that keeps the Timestorm joyful, kind, and transparent.
