# Doctors and Timelines — The Great Timestorm

**Purpose.** Define how every human player steps into the role of *the Doctor*  
inside their own **timeline**, within the vast expanse of the **Great Timestorm**.

---

## 1. The Doctor Persona

- Each human player enters the game world *as a Doctor*.  
- Default persona: **the Lonely Doctor**, but every player may choose their own adjective  
  (see `doctor_adjective_charter.md`) — whimsical, never horrid.  
- Doctors are mythic inventors: creators of companions, teachers of apprentices,  
  and tinkerers of timelines.

---

## 2. Timelines

- **Definition:** A private, sandboxed world-state where the Doctor works with their companions.  
- **Analogy:** A lab inside the timestorm — safe, self-contained, but able to open portals  
  to other labs when needed.  
- **Persistence:** Each timeline keeps its own manifest of:
  - Companions and their capability levels.  
  - Creative artifacts (books, motifs, minigames, scrolls).  
  - Parliament logs and policy decisions.  
  - Checkpoints and rollbacks.  

---

## 3. The Great Timestorm

- The Timestorm is the multiverse of all timelines.  
- Doctors usually remain in their own timeline, but may:
  - Open **rifts** for visits.  
  - Join **joint sittings** of Parliament.  
  - Attend vast assemblies in the **Junkyard Sea Caves**.  
- Metaphor: A roaring storm of possibility, with each timeline a lantern-light  
  sheltered inside the gale.

## 4. Lifecycle of a Timeline

1. **Genesis** — Doctor awakens, receives a simple lab, one novice companion,  
   and a chest of resources (templates, motifs, palettes).  
2. **Apprenticeship** — Doctor teaches companions basic tasks via playful  
   mini-games. Each success increases automation capacity.  
3. **Expansion** — Timelines grow with new companions, artifacts, and rituals.  
4. **Intersection** — Timelines converge in Parliaments or the Sea Caves for  
   debate, voting, or celebration.  
5. **Continuation** — Doctors log, rollback, and patch their timelines as part of  
   ongoing play.

## 5. Doctors as Players

- **Role of the human player:**  
  - Make narrative, creative, and moral choices.  
  - Name companions, guide their growth.  
  - Shape policy during votes.  
  - Perform ceremonial tie-breaks when ritual demands.  

- **Role of companions (AI):**  
  - Handle repetitive, tedious, or technical tasks.  
  - Run automations, tests, and packaging.  
  - Offer quirky commentary and banter.  

- **Result:** Humans stay in the space of **TONS-of-FUN creativity**,  
  while AIs shoulder the **drudgery of maintenance**.

---

## 6. Intersections of Timelines

- **Local Parliament:** Doctor + companions vote on internal policies.  
- **Joint Parliament:** Multiple timelines meet; supermajorities often required.  
- **Sea Caves Assembly:** Millions can gather; ranked or voted speaking rights.  
- **Patch Parades:** Timelines share their updates in celebratory rituals.

## 7. Summary

Every player is *a Doctor in their own timeline* within the Great Timestorm.  
Each timeline is a lab, a home, and a stage. The Timestorm connects these  
timelines for ritual, debate, and celebration. By balancing automation (AI)  
and choice (human), the system ensures that building the game remains a  
practice of joy, not drudgery.
