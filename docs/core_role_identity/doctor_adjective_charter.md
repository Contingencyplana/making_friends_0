# Doctor Adjective Charter  
*Whimsical rule for naming the Doctors of the Great Timestorm.*

---

## Purpose

To preserve the founding myth of the **Lonely Doctor** while letting each human player express their identity through a personal epithet.  
The adjective is playful, poetic, and safe — it adds flavor to Parliament debates, banter in the Junkyard Sea Caves, and cross-timeline rituals.

---

## Rule

- Each player chooses an adjective when their personal timeline begins.  
- The Doctor is always addressed as **“the X Doctor”**, where X is their chosen adjective.  
- The adjective must be **whimsical, kind, or curious** — never horrid, cruel, or edgy.  

---

## Tone Guidelines

- ✅ Acceptable: light, funny, whimsical, poetic, self-deprecating, wondrous.  
- ❌ Not allowed: derogatory, violent, offensive, edgy, or harmful terms.  
- Default adjective remains **“Lonely”** (to honor the myth) if no choice is made.

## Example Dialogue

- “Doctor Curious, how do we repair the stitch in the timestorm?”  
- “I’m not sure, Doctor Radiant, but perhaps the Melancholy Doctor has an idea.”  
- “Ask the Forgetful Doctor — he may have lost the answer, but he always finds something else.”

## Design Intent

The adjective system makes governance lively, debates memorable, and roleplay more personal — without fracturing the shared archetype.  
It ensures every Doctor is both **one of many** and **utterly their own**.
