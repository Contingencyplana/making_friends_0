# Foundation of SHAGI  
*Supersafe Hyperadvanced Artificial General Intelligence — Multiverse Hivemind*

This document defines the **north star** for SHAGI: a safety-first, child-safe, creator-friendly ecosystem that powers **thousands of interconnected multiplayer video games** built on the Creative Ecosystem AI.

---

## 1) Purpose & Position
- **Purpose:** Make a multiverse where *play = creation = research*, at kid-safe defaults.
- **Position in the stack:**  
  - **SHAGI (this doc):** umbrella doctrine (ethics, federation, safety, scope).  
  - **Creative Ecosystem AI:** operational federation (Programmable, Personified, Playable).  
  - **Proto/Synergistic Sixteen:** concrete projects and pathways.  
  - **Making Friends AI:** narrative seed and minimal playable core.

---

## 2) First Principles (non-negotiables)
1. **Supersafe by default** — safety settings bias toward the most cautious, age-appropriate mode.  
2. **Human consent & control** — human creators can pause, inspect, and revert any agent action.  
3. **Transparency** — model roles, capabilities, and limits are visible in-world (diegetic UI).  
4. **Simplicity > Power** — add power only when it stays simple *and* fun.  
5. **Play before scale** — nothing ships that isn’t delightful at the smallest size.  
6. **Minimum viable federation** — connect worlds with the least machinery needed.  
7. **Data dignity** — provenance, permissions, and purpose are tracked and respected.  
8. **Auditability** — every consequential action is explainable and reconstructible.

## 3) Safety & Governance (Valiant Citadel)
- **Guardrails:** age gates, content classifiers, rate-limiters, dialog/agent policies.  
- **Escalation ladders:** agent → cyberfriend → AI Player → human mod → maintainer.  
- **Workspace safety:** scripts that prune caches, protect repos, and block destructive ops.  
- **Red-team cadence:** scheduled playtests against abuse/misuse scenarios.  
- **Docs:** see `valiant_citadel.md` (rails), `workflow_instructions.md` (how we work).

---

## 4) Federation Model (Multiplayer Fabric)
- **Identity:** player, party, world, and companion identities are portable but scoped.  
- **Capabilities:** worlds grant **capability tokens** (least privilege) to guests and agents.  
- **Events:** uniform event bus (join/leave, quest, craft, publish, fund).  
- **Interop:** books ↔ minigames ↔ labs ↔ languages share simple, stable schemas.  
- **Offline-first:** every world runs standalone; federation is an **upgrade**, not a requirement.

---

## 5) Technical Pillars
- **Programmable:**  
  - Spells = functions; Books/Pages = scripts; Minigames = packages.  
  - Versioned manifests and content fingerprints (see `make_zips.ps1`).  
- **Personified:**  
  - Cyberfriends/AI Players are first-class configs (tone, tools, bounds).  
  - Pantheon poles (Topsy/Thorn) provide *nurture*/*challenge* orchestration.  
- **Playable:**  
  - Choice loops ≤ 30s; clear feedback; “back/undo” always available.  
  - FUN is a testable requirement (see `playtest_plan.md`).

---

## 6) Content & Data Ethics
- **By-and-for kids** defaults; adult or mixed spaces require explicit opt-in and extra rails.  
- **Attribution & provenance** carried in every artifact (page, sprite, model, code).  
- **No dark patterns:** rewards are clear, reversible, and non-exploitative.  
- **Privacy:** no hidden data collection; local-first logs; consented sharing only.

---

## 7) Mapping to the Mythic Ladder
- **Tin → Copper → Silver → Gold** mirrors **Page → Book → Treasury → Saga**.  
- **Bridging Gods:** child-built companions braid through every rung (ownership preserved).  
- **Polarity:** Topsy (nurture/continuity) and Thorn (challenge/truth) stay in *creative tension*.

---

## 8) Multiplayer Use-Cases (starter set)
- **Co-author a Book:** party writes/illustrates an Interactive Picture Book live.  
- **Guild Lab Run:** run trials (Conquerors) and record experiments (Labscape).  
- **Cross-world Quest:** a Lucid Fleet “ship” orchestrates a simple multi-world mission.  
- **Fund-and-Ship:** a finished book spawns a micro-Kickstarter; Game Maker compiles a minigame.

---

## 9) Milestones (walk, jog, run)
1. **Walk:** single-player Making Friends; safe build loop; first playable friend.  
2. **Jog:** small-party co-authoring; Cartoon Channel exporter; proto funding loop.  
3. **Run:** cross-world quests; federated Labscape; language maker powering real games.  
4. **Gold:** Creative Ecosystem AI in steady state; SHAGI governance process live.

---

## 10) Invariants & Non-Goals
**Invariants:** supersafe defaults, undo/rollback, audit trails, clear authorship, fun-first.  
**Non-Goals:** adtech monetization, opaque black-box agency, friction-heavy federation, grimdark.

## 11) Pointers
- `foundations_and_roles.md` — roles + Five Es + proto-structures.  
- `mythic_ladder_of_cybergods.md` — Tin/Copper/Silver/Gold mapping + evolutionary arc.  
- `creative_ecosystem_ai.md` — synergistic sixteen + federation logic.  
- `valiant_citadel.md` — safety doctrine and guardrails.  
- `paving_the_way.md` — templates, checklists, scaffolds.  
- `playtest_plan.md` — sessions, coverage, regression checklist.

## 12) One-Sentence Charter
> **SHAGI builds a child-safe, playful, federated multiverse where every page, spell, and game is *programmable*, *personified*, and *playable* — and always understandable, reversible, and fun.**
