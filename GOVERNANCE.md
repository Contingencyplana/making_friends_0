# Governance (Lightweight)

---

## 1. Vision & Roles
- **The Lonely Doctor** — Vision Holder: sets the overall vision and final direction.  
- **Igor, the Great Planner** — Keeper of the Planning Great Chair: governs planning caverns, charters, Decision Records (DRs), and carries minimal lab oversight to prevent stalling.  
- **Ivy, the Great Whitecoat** — Keeper of the Whitecoat Great Chair: oversees friends, tests, runtime, and the creative engine of Making Friends AI.  

Support agents:  
- **GPT-5** — proposes strategy/tactics, supplies terminal commands, full-file replacements.  
- **Copilot Pro** — implements code edits inline.

## 2. Decision Flow
Decisions follow a structured promotion path:  
1. **Draft** → rough notes in a planning cave.  
2. **Proposal** → promoted to Planning Parliament (North) or Whitecoat Parliament (South).  
3. **Motion & Vote** → deliberation in Parliament.  
4. **Decision Record (DR)** → sealed scroll (canonical).  
5. **Execution** → carried out in caves/friends/tests.  
6. **Review & Release** → validated, curated into distributables.

**Rule:** *No decision is binding until ratified by a DR.*

## 3. Principles
- **Safety > Shipping**  
- **Simplicity > Features**  
- **Traceability**: every release cites the DRs that changed scope.

## 4. Escalation Ladder
If conflict or failure arises, escalate in this order:  
1. **Agent** (script, builder, Copilot)  
2. **Cyberfriend** (lab entity)  
3. **AI Player** (workspace-level)  
4. **Human Moderator** (final arbiter)

*Governance ensures balance between the Planner and the Whitecoat,  
between scroll and experiment,  
between storm and storm.*
