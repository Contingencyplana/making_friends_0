# Dual Roadmap — Supreme Simplicity AI + Making Friends AI

A living guide for balancing the **framework** (Supreme Simplicity AI) and the **flagship** (Making Friends AI).  
Treat this file as a scroll consulted by the Doctor and Igor when the path forks between **simplicity** and **fun**. 

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations (Now → Near Term)

**Goal:** Establish clean workspaces and minimal play loops.

### ⚙️ Supreme Simplicity AI (Framework)
- ✅ Already: `make_zips.ps1`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, virtual environment, smoke test.  
- ⏭ Next steps:  
  - [ ] Add a `tests/` suite that touches early spell functions.  
  - [ ] Document **How to Play the Engine** → short README with `Ctrl+Shift+B → zip → upload`.  
  - [ ] Introduce 1–2 *complexity bosses* (e.g., scripted puzzle where unnecessary files appear and must be cleaned).  

### 🎭 Making Friends AI (Flagship)
- ⏭ Next steps:  
  - [ ] Boot minimal game loop (Mad Doctor + Igor) with 1 choice → 1 file/folder spawn.  
  - [ ] Add “heartbeat friend” mechanic (Igor laughs, Grumble groans).  
  - [ ] Write 2–3 whimsical `story.md` stubs (storm, lab, first sparks).  
  - [ ] Confirm build/zip flow mirrors Supreme Simplicity AI → **no chaos**.  

---

## Phase 2 — Parallel Growth (Mid Term)

**Goal:** Grow both projects in sync; each feeds the other.  

### ⚙️ Supreme Simplicity AI
- [ ] Add *complexity shields* → scripts that stop runaway recursion.  
- [ ] Build out 2–3 mini tools:  
  - `cleanup.ps1` → auto-purge cache/noise.  
  - `validate.py` → confirm structure.  
  - `report.md` → snapshot status.  
- [ ] Tie these into story: **Doctor vs. Chaos Entities.**  

### 🎭 Making Friends AI
- [ ] Expand friend roster (Igor, Grumble, others).  
- [ ] Introduce play loop with stakes:  
  - Doctor builds → friend helps → friend gains quirks.  
- [ ] Light puzzles with emotional payoffs (“Igor learns a word, Grumble makes a joke”).  
- [ ] Prepare vertical slice for playtest (~10–15 minutes of fun).  
- [ ] Draft Kickstarter pitch materials (demo video, art mockups).  

---

## Phase 3 — Convergence (Longer Term)

**Goal:** Ensure synergy → framework empowers flagship.  

### ⚙️ Supreme Simplicity AI
- [ ] Expose its complexity monitors inside Making Friends AI.  
- [ ] Friends whisper warnings when recursion grows unstable.  
- [ ] Framework tools appear in-story as magical lab gadgets.  

### 🎭 Making Friends AI
- [ ] Scale to chapter-sized adventures (multiple rooms, multiple friends).  
- [ ] Add TONS-of-FUN loops:  
  - Friends can argue, joke, or combine powers.  
- [ ] Player’s lab fills with artifacts (actually Supreme Simplicity’s framework features).  
- [ ] Commercial push: Early Access / Kickstarter.

## Prioritization (So You Don’t Get Overwhelmed)

- **Right now** → keep *Supreme Simplicity AI* clean and stable. Only build minimal tools.  
- Pour creativity into *Making Friends AI* → more fun, broader appeal.  
- Every **2–3 steps** in Making Friends AI, pause to harden Supreme Simplicity AI.  
- Treat *Supreme Simplicity AI* as the **safety rails**, not the star of the show.  

👉 **Rule of Thumb**:  
- If it’s **fun/whimsical** → Making Friends AI.  
- If it’s **safety/structure** → Supreme Simplicity AI.
