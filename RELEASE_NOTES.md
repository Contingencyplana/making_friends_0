# Release Notes

Short, friendly notes for GitHub Releases.

Each entry should include:
- **What changed** — summary of features, fixes, or docs added.  
- **How to run** — quick steps or commands if anything new needs testing.  
- **Any cautions** — warnings, migration steps, or known issues.  
- **Decisions referenced** — list of **DR-IDs** (Decision Records) that shaped this release.
